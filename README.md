PyInvestment
===

PyInvestment is still very *pre-alpha* and under active development.

#### Project Goals
  * Provide a simple yet extensible framework to perform real time quantitative financial analysis.
  * Provide a backtesting system to allow the user to test their trading strategy in as realistic of conditions as they see fit.
  * Be simple enough for a beginner to pick up and use while being sophisticated enough that professionals will *need* to use it.
  * Allow the user to use whatever data they want.

### Contributing
Being pre-alpha means that we *need* contributors to help make this project a success. 
Don't hesitate to send me an email with questions or even a pull request with a new feature you think would fit into our framework.
